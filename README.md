# VanVu

Starting point for implementation of the Van Vu algorithms.

Main method is contained in the class SVDI.java.
In this SVDI.java class file you can change parameters such as numClusters, clusterSize, interiorProb, and exteriorProb.

Main method generates a random graph subject to the paramaters and uses SVD I to find an appropriate geometric representation.

The geometric representation can be found in the Matrix parameter "projectedPoints." Feel free to use this and your favorite
Clustering by Distances algorithm to find the graph clusters.
